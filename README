XFce4 XKB Layouts panel plugin.

Information
===========

This plugin allows you to setup and use multiple (currently
ip to 4 due to X11 protocol limitation) keyboard layouts.

You can choose the keyboard model, what key combination to
use to switch between the layouts, the actual keyboard layouts,
the way in which the current layout is being displayed (country
flag image or text) and the layout policy, which is whether to
store the layout globally (for all windows), per application or
per window.

If a certain flag is missing, the plugin will fallback to
displaying the layout as text.

The plugin detects any change in the layout configuration
(e.g. setxkbmap invokations) and reconfigures itself to use
the new settings.

Known limitations and bugs
==========================

Currently if one sets any Xkb options, besides the grp: ones
they will be lost the next time the plugin is started. Even
more - only the first grp: option present in the running
configuration will be stored in the config file and thus only
it will be restored the next time the plugin is started. This
will be resolved in future versions.
